This repository contains my code for the 2020-2021 competition season.

The directory where the code can be found [here](https://github.com/D3rpyDolphin/FtcRobotController2020-21/tree/master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc).

[Robotlib](https://github.com/D3rpyDolphin/FtcRobotController2020-21/tree/master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotlib) is a module intended to be used in future seasons.
The main logic can be found in [team code](https://github.com/D3rpyDolphin/FtcRobotController2020-21/tree/master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode).

The main accomplishments of this years code was much improved modularity from the previous year along with a very general vision program. This enabled the creation of a fairly sophisticated autonomous program by First robotics standards. However, due to the only engineer being unable to build the robot, the none vision code remains untested.
